# Multi Stage Docker Build

The main purpose of choosing a golang based applciation to demostrate this example is golang is a statically-typed programming language that does not require a runtime in the traditional sense. Unlike dynamically-typed languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which rely on a runtime environment to execute their code, Go compiles directly to machine code, which can then be executed directly by the operating system.

Advantage : 

So the real advantage of multi stage docker build and distro less images can be understand with a drastic decrease in the Image size and aslo the container image that we have is running securely and that docker image is very less vulnerable to the threats.
